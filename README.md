# Simple Shop Website

This repository contains a minimal example of a shopping website built with static HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The site lets users view products and add them to a simple cart.

## Running Locally

To preview the website on your machine, open `index.html` in a web browser or start a local server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

To make the site publicly accessible:

1. Create a new repository on GitHub and push this code.
2. In the repository settings, enable **GitHub Pages** and choose the branch that contains these files (usually `main` or `master`).
3. After a minute, GitHub will provide a URL like `https://<username>.github.io/<repository>` where the site is hosted.

The generated link can be shared with others so they can access the site from any browser.
